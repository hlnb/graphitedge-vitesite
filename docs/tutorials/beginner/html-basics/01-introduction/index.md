# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that helps us structure content on the web. Think of it as the skeleton of a web page - it defines the structure and meaning of content rather than its appearance.

## How Websites Work

When you visit a website:

1. Your browser requests files from a web server
2. The server sends back HTML files
3. Your browser reads the HTML and displays the content
4. Additional files (CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity) enhance the basic HTML structure

## Basic Tools You'll Need

To start writing HTML, you only need two things:

1. **A Text Editor**
   - VS Code (recommended)
   - Sublime Text
   - Notepad++ (Windows)
2. **A Web Browser**
   - Chrome (recommended)
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge

::: tip
While you can use any text editor, we recommend VS Code because it offers helpful features like:

- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion
- Live preview extensions
  :::

## HTML Elements

HTML uses "elements" to structure content. An element typically consists of:

- An opening tag: `<tagname>`
- The content
- A closing tag: `</tagname>`

For example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## Try It Yourself

Let's write your first piece of HTML:

1. Open your text editor
2. Type this simple HTML:

```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is my first HTML element.</p>
```

3. Save the file as `hello.html`
4. Open it in your web browser

## What's Next?

In the next lesson, we'll create your first complete HTML page and learn about the essential elements every HTML document needs.

::: info Practice
Before moving on, try:

1. Creating different headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
2. Writing multiple paragraphs
3. Opening your files in different browsers to see how they look

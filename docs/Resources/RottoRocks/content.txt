_Brief History of the Island_

Rottnest Island, known as Wadjemup to the Noongar people, has a rich history dating back over 30,000 years.

In 1696, Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh mistook the native quokkas for large rats, naming the island "Rattennest," meaning "rat's nest," which later evolved into Rottnest Island.

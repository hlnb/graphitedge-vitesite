After 20 years in web development and training countless students, I've developed a clear pathway for beginners to enter the web development field. This guide combines my military training methodology with industry best practices to create a structured learning approach.

## The Foundation Triangle: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Before diving into frameworks and advanced concepts, mastering these three core technologies is crucial:

### 1. HTML - Structure First

- Understanding semantic markup

- Responsive design principles
- CSS variables and modern features

### 3. JavaScript - Adding Interactivity

- Core language concepts

- Event handling
- Asynchronous programming basics

## Creating Your Learning Plan

### Week 1-4: HTML & CSS Foundations

### Week 9-12: Modern Development Practices

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Rushing to frameworks before basics

Remember: consistent practice and building real projects are key to success in web development.
